    <h1>The Capture</h1>
    <p>My super power is I can shoot people and able to freeze time. By using super gear called camera I can caputre a image which is freezing the moment and later becomes a beautiful memory.</p>

    <h1>String Hashing</h1>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-hashing-using-polynomial-rolling-hash-function/">String hashing is the way to convert a string into an integer known as a hash of that string.
        An ideal hashing is the one in which there are minimum chances of collision (i.e 2 different strings having the same hash).</blockquote> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-hashing-using-polynomial-rolling-hash-function/">Click here for source link.</a>
        <p>Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string s, which contains only lowercase letters. We convert each character of s to an integer. Here we use the conversion a→1, b→2, …, z→26. Converting a→0 is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings a, aa, aaa, … all evaluate to 0.</p>
        <pre>
            long long compute_hash(string const& s) {
                const int p = 31;
                const int m = 1e9 + 9;
                long long hash_value = 0;
                long long p_pow = 1;
                for (char c : s) {
                    hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
                    p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;
                }
                return hash_value;
            }
